# Context
Nourish is a simple webapp to neatly display recipes written by other users.
The main feed allows the perusal of various recipes via a ordering preference, these are;
* Newest
* Alphabetical
* Cost
* Preparation Time
* Vegan, etc

Tapping any recipe will load up it's information and cooking instructions. With tick boxes beside each ingredient to make shopping easier

Logging in will allow users to create new recipes:
* Add an image
* Add ingredients
* Description
* Cost/prep time & veganism



# Why?
Improve my understanding of React. In the past I used vanilla React without any hooks. This time I plan to implement primarily only hooks and redux.
Additionally, I'd like to learn typescript which feeds well into GraphQL, overkill for this project but a great introduction.
